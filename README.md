2048 Game Project
This project includes two versions of the classic 2048 game:

User-Play Mode: The traditional gameplay where the player combines numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to create a tile with the number 2048. The player can swipe tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right) to move all tiles in that direction. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a new tile with the sum of their numbers.

AI Auto-Play Mode: An automated version of the game where the computer plays the game using the Alpha-Beta pruning and Minimax algorithms to determine the optimal moves. The AI aims to reach the 2048 tile by making strategic decisions based on the current state of the game board. You can start the game by pressing the 'S' key.
